# What is this?

This project demonstrates these mutually challenging charateristics:

* Google Chrome Extension
* ... preserving access to `chrome.runtime`
* ES6 import in the content_script
* Custom Elements aka WebComponent, or at the very least `customElements.define()`

## Credits:

This repo started off as a working example of this Medium Article:

[How to use ES6 “import” with Chrome Extension - Hiromu OCHIAI - Medium](https://medium.com/@otiai10/how-to-use-es6-import-with-chrome-extension-bd5217b9c978)

It was then extended by [Shawn Murphy](https://github.com/smurp) to include support for WebComponents.
